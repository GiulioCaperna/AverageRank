# AverageRank
In this repository I collected the R functions for the computation of average rank and other codes connected to the use of poset theory for the computation of composite (or synthetic) indicators.  

Fundamental references:
1) Br√ºggemann and Carlsen (2011), LPOMext
2) Fattore and Arcagni (2014), PARSEC
3) De Loof et al (2011), Another approximation proposal
4) Caperna (2016), Partial Order theory for Synthetic Indicators, PhD thesis, Padova

Please consider giving the proper recognition to these works. At the beginning of every file you can find which is the used reference.
